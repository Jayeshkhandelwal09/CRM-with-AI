## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES - NOW FIXED**

### **❌ BEFORE (Vulnerable)**
```javascript
// OLD CODE - NO FILTERING
if (!objectionText || objectionText.length > 1000) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Objection text is required and must be under 1000 characters'
  });
}
// AI PROCESSED ANY CONTENT - INCLUDING ABUSIVE/INAPPROPRIATE
```

### **✅ AFTER (Secure)**
```javascript
// NEW CODE - COMPREHENSIVE FILTERING
// 1. Enhanced input validation
if (!objectionText || typeof objectionText !== 'string') {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Objection text is required and must be a string'
  });
}

// 2. CONTENT FILTERING - Critical security check
console.log(`🔍 Filtering objection content for user ${userId}`);
const filterResult = await this.contentFilter.filterContent(objectionText, 'objection_handler');

// 3. Log filtering events for monitoring
await this.contentFilter.logFilteringEvent(userId, objectionText, filterResult, 'objection_handler');

// 4. BLOCK inappropriate content
if (!filterResult.isAllowed) {
  console.log(`🚫 Content rejected for user ${userId}: ${filterResult.reason} (${filterResult.severity})`);
  
  // Return safe fallback response
  const safeFallback = this.contentFilter.getSafeFallbackResponse('objection_handler', filterResult.reason);
  
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Your input contains inappropriate content. Please rephrase professionally.',
    contentViolation: {
      reason: filterResult.reason,
      severity: filterResult.severity,
      guidance: 'Please ensure your objection is business-appropriate and professional.'
    },
    fallbackResponse: safeFallback.data
  });
}
```
